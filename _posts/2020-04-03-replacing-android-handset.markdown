My old MotoG stopped working on the weekend. I'm
glad certainly I backed my pictures up before then! I used[ Titanium Backup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup&hl=en)
to backup my photos of my wife and kids to a storage drive I kept nearby. Google photos
would be useful. I bought my MotoG in Shanghai where they do not have Google so it did
not come included with it.

I have been watching Android ROM for some time thanks to no Google in China. This
weekend I will try to build them first for my MotoG and then if I struggle too hard
(I would rather code than build heheðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ ) I might buy new hardware. I don't want
[Google because of COVID-19 tracking](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/google-coronavirus-data-1.5520194).

* [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/Changelog-24/)
  * Lineage upgrade recently and support my [MotoG](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/falcon)
* [OmniROM](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-8-1-omnirom-oneplus-5t-hands-on/)
* [CopperheadOS ](https://copperhead.co/android)
  * Only for Pixel 3 and 3a so I need to buy new hardware
* [AOSP EXTENDED](https://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g/development/rom-aospextended-rom-v7-0-t4058451)
  * Seems updated and reliable. Not official! though. Where security patches?

** UPDATE** I found NetHunter (Kali hacker System for Linux) port
[for my MotoG](https://github.com/alexyang-pixel/NETHUNTER-for-falcon). I can try this too. 

Here is my poor MotoG. Hope we find you a new home this weekend! I will
search [XDA forums for MotoG roms here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g)
